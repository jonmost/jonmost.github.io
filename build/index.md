<h1>How to Create A Digital Service Acquisition</h1>

Okay, before we start building your Request for Quote (RFQ), let's get an estimate. Currently we offer two methods. The first, <strong>App Estimator,</strong> will help you estimate the cost and rescources associated with building a single app.  The Second, <strong>Agile Estimator</strong> will help you build an estimate for what we call <em>"agile in a box"</em> (i.e., an iterative development team).

<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>If you are looking to build an app, let's start here:</p>
<p><div><FORM>
<INPUT TYPE="button" VALUE="App Estimator" onClick="parent.location='https://pre-award.herokuapp.com/'">
</FORM>
</div></p>

<p>If you need ongoing development services or are looking to build a series of capabilities click the button below:</p>
<p><div><FORM>
<INPUT TYPE="button" VALUE="Agile Estimator" onClick="parent.location='https://acquisition-planning-beta.herokuapp.com/agile_estimator'">
</FORM></div></p>

In addition to the applications above you can check out the [GSA Contract Awarded Labor Category (CALC)](https://calc.gsa.gov/) tool.


<strong>Looks like you are ready to start building your Digital Service Acquisition, that's great!</strong> Click on the Req Builder  button below to get started. This is still a beta version so it is limited to the recomended Fixed Price per Iteration model. This tool includes the best practices from the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/">Digital Service Play Book</a>

#How to Create A Digital Service Acquisition 

Okay, before we start building your Request for Quote (RFQ), let's get and estimate. Currently we offer two methods. The first, <strong>App Estimator,/strong> will help you estimate the cost and rescources associated with building a single app.  The Second, <strong>Agile Estimator</strong> will help you build an estimate for what we call <em>"agile in a box"</em>

<strong>Looks like you are ready to start building your Digital Service Acquisition, that's great!</strong> Click on the Req Builder  button below to get started. This is still a beta version so it is limited to the recomended Fixed Price per Iteration model. This tool includes the best practices from the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/">Digital Service Play Book</a>

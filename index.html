Okay, before we start building your Request for Quote (RFQ), let's get an estimate. Currently we offer two methods. The first, <strong>App Estimator,</strong> will help you estimate the cost and rescources associated with building a single app.  The Second, <strong>Agile Team Builder</strong> will help you build an estimate for what we call <em>"agile in a box"</em> (i.e., an iterative development team).

<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>Choose your estimation tool below:</p>

  <div class="button_wrapper">
    <a class="usa-button-hover" type="button" href="https://pre-award.herokuapp.com">App Estimator</a>
    <a class="usa-button-active" type="button" href="https://acquisition-planning-beta.herokuapp.com/agile_estimator">Agile Team Builder</a>
 
  </div>
 <p></p>

<strong>Looks like you are ready to start building your Digital Service Acquisition, that's great!</strong> Click on the Playbook-In-Action button below to get started. This is still a beta version so it is limited to the recomended Fixed Price per Iteration model. This tool includes the best practices from the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/">Digital Service Play Book</a>

<h1>Digital Service Acquisition Communities</h1>
As you move through your journey there will be questions, <strong>that is a good thing!</strong> In support of this we have created  <strong>DITAP Chat</strong> to allow discussions amongst <em>anyone</em> interested in Digital Service Acquisitions. Coming soon we will also have a DITAP Blog which will allow members of the federal acquisition community to share their experiences. In addition, if you wish to note additional groups, please

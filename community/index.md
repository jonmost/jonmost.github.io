<h1>Digital Service Acquisition Communities</h1>
The Digital Services Playbook and the TechFAR Handbook are tremendous resources, but the Federal-wide TechFAR Hub was launched with the vision of moving beyond recomendations. Employees across the Federal Government are ready to raise the bar by sharing expertise, experience, and insights with the Community. In support of this we have created <strong>DITAP Chat</strong> to allow discussions amongst anyone interested in Digital Service Acquisitions. Coming soon we will also have a DITAP Blog which will allow members of the federal acquisition community to share their experiences. In addition, if you wish to note additional groups, please
